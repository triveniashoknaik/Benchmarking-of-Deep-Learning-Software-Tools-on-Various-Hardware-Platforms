# Benchmarking-of-Deep-Learning-Software-Tools-on-Various-Hardware-Platforms
This paper directs to make a relative study of the deep learning software tools such as Tensor Flow, Caffe, Torch, MXNet, CNTK which are GPU accelerated. The handouts from this work is bifold. First, for the users of the deep learning tools, the benchmarking outcome will act as a model in choosing the suitable set of software tools and hardware environments. Second, for the developers of deep learning software tools, the survey aims at providing directions down the line to upgrade the running performance.
